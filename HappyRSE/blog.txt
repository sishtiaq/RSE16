Be a Happy RSE

# An Apology

I conceived, organized and ran the "Be A Happy RSE" workshop at
RSE16. In this post, I want to tell you how I did this, what happened
there, and share some ideas on what to do next. I'd be very happy to
receive your thoughts or feedback on the session itself.

Now, you're always told never to begin a talk by apologizing, but I
will begin this article by saying sorry to the RSE organizers. I'm
sorry that our session overran. I'm sorry that everyone was talking so
much (and so intensely!) that I didn't have the heart to interrupt
them and move them. I'm sorry that the conference had to end later
than planned. And, while the train derailment wasn't my fault, I'm
sorry to any attendees who missed their train.

There, I'm happier with that off my chest. 

# Intro

I had been thinking explicitly of happiness for a few months. I had
attended a 10-week course on Raising Teens (brilliant course, TODO
cambs.gov.uk link, if you have a chance locally to attend something
like this, do) recently. Lots of things that you think of as American
buzzwords, well they can be treated as American buzzwords, or you can
reflect on them more seriously, with good intension. Ideas like
resilience, support, boundaries, praise, labels, deeds-not-doers,
Maslow. Part of the purpose of a course like this (you find out, it's
never said to you explicitly) is to think about *yourself*, not about
your teen. So I had been thinking about what my resilience was like?
Was I happy?

It was a short jump from there to, while proposing F#+Z3 as a workshop
to RSE16 (got rejected, boohoo, I wasn't happy!), I thought: I'm a
research engineer, what makes me happy might also be what makes others
happy; how about I run a session on happiness for RSEs? It was a short
jump but a scary one: to think that I could just go in and talk about
being happy. And, no, I hadn't done anything like this before. But, I
thought, I don't have the answers, but maybe others have some of
them. Why not share what we have?

I proposed the session to the RSE organizers. They said yes . But were
concerned that cynics might sink the workshop; that too many people
would just use it to dump baggage. But I wasn't running it for that
reason; I wanted most people to come away with a positive outcome.

# Structure of session

Once I got the go-ahead from the organizers I had to get my gear in
action on how to organize the workshop.  I knew pretty much what I
*didn't* want: I don't want to just talk at the front of the room; it
would be boring to hear just me go on about happiness.  (Not that I
could, anyway: I didn't have all the answers. Heck, I mostly felt I
didn't have any of the answers); I wanted everyone to hear what
everyone else had to say. 

I talked to my wife Zoe at the dinner table a lot (we have to talk to
each other, otherwise the dinner conversation would involve only our
children talking about Bunny v Monkey farts). I talked to Tom Crick
(Cardiff Met), Ben Hall (Cambridge MRC), Kenji Takeda
(azure4research), John Bronskill (MSR) and Matthew Johnson (MSR). I
showed them my notes [HappyRSE.md] and discussed how to run the
session. In the end, I stole the format of the Raising Teens group
work sessions: we'll split up into four groups. There will be four
stations, each with a specific topic to talk about. A group per
station. They will talk and take enough notes on the flipchart to be
able to give a summary at the end. After every 10/15mins, we would
rotate.  Right at the end of the entire session, after three
rotations, we'd have everyone report back on their summaries.

The four topics I wanted us to talk about was Here & Now, Work I, Work 
II, and Life. I wanted them to analyze (moan, dump luggage); then 
discuss; and lastly come up with actions. 

# On the Day

I took 5 or 10 minutes at the beginning of the session to say how the
session would be run, and what we'd be talking about. I confessed
up-front that I didn't know how to make them happy. But I did say that
I was happy that they weren't going to the C++ and go sessions that
were being run in parallel. By making this choice for themselves, I
said, they already realized a crucial part of the story: that being
happy was their choice. I said that, at the end of the session, it
would be nice if everyone could come away with a short menu of actions
they could do (maybe now, maybe some time in the future) for them to
be happier.

# Topic 1: Here & Now

In the Here & Now topic, I wanted to people to say why they were here,
not as an existential question, but, literally, why didn't they go to
the C++ session? Are they happy or unhappy now, and if so why? Did
they want to be an RSE (maybe they were a failed researcher, maybe
they wanted to be an engineer from the start)? 

I had thought that people would be happy if they felt they were doing
something useful and if they were valued. I told the story of my 10yo
son: I asked him what made him happy; he thought and said "I'm happy
because I'm so busy".

Or maybe some people didn't want to be happy? A "refusal to win", to
borrow a phrase.

The discussion brought up many useful answers to these questions. RSEs
were generally happy.  They liked working with others, they liked
solving problem ("tenacity" one person said), they liked what they
were doing, they like being busy.  The vast majority of the RSEs there
were employed by institutions that allowed them autonomy and freedom
to be in control of their own work; they had good ("contained" one
person said) work hours.

For some, learning how to make others happy made them happy.

Many said that the UK RSE made them happy (good job, UK RSE!). It
gave them recognition of their role, their status, in their work. It
also meant that they were a part of a community that they didn't know
existed before. Several people said that they always wanted to be an
RSE but didn't know what to call it or what it was; when they found UK
RSE, it was as if they'd found home. For some, UK RSE unblocked their
career path via their EPSRC Fellowship; for others, their RSE role was
a re-start, opening up new avenues. Others (maybe more junior?) did
say, on the other hand, that there was still uncertainty in their
role, they were missing feedback, they had a lack of recognition.

In his keynote talk, Matthew Johnson had talked about the spectrum of
an RSE: from SDE/dev/IT to Researcher. This is a good concept, with
both positive and negative implications. Many people said that they
enjoyed the dual aspects of Software Enginerring and domain expertise:
they produce something that is used again and again: the obvious
analogy is to a successful paper cited many times. On the other hand,
quite a lot of journals have no need for code in publication; there is
no recognition by journals of this work. And there might be any job
security despite good software/ download statistics. Completely on the
other end, an RSE might not write papers, they might only do
releases. The analogy to a researcher was highlighted by one person
who said: "A senior PI doesn't do research"; so what's the analogous
role of a senior RSE?


# Work 1

There were two "work" topics. "Work 1" was about the relationship an
RSE has with specific others: with their researchers, with their
manager, with their Director or Head of Dept. It also covers an RSE
and their project.

It's the old joke about programmers who say that their life would be
so much easier if it weren't for their users. But others exist, and we
have to deal with them so we might as well make a good job of it. 

An RSEs relationship with a Researcher is a particuarly interesting
one, because the Researcher is on the other end of the spectrum, the
real The Other inside you. What makes a Researcher a Reseacher, and an
Engineer an Engineer?  I've come across Researchers who want to do the
ideal (and so never finish), and Researchers who write just enough
code to make this one paper work.

Researchers presenting some results of my work in very nice
environment.  who is presenting my work? researchers at "their"
conferences --> :-(

Evaluation of RSE work by RSE; researcher as stakeholder not "boss"
makes *both* sides happier.

Then there's managers. Over time, as many institutions are becoming
more corporate (complaints > /dev/null please), an RSE will start to
have a manager, maybe several "matrix" managers. Often these managers
might not know what they are doing (over-promoted, innocent, greasy
pole climbing, put your standard cliche here) and the new managers
might need active managing themselves. Sometimes your new manager
might be your old friend and colleague; what do you do then?

The discussion brought out many opinions of managers. Some had a lot
of autonomy, a lack of management (a good thing?!), or an
informal/collaborative management (someone said that this could cause
problems); some had a good relationship with their manager, and used
them as a sounding board; some had multiple managers.

Many RSEs reported that they had a lot of freedom to decide the
project path. They liked working in projects, there was a team spirit
there, in which a shared understanding makes for happy
collaboration. They felt they had a unique and crtical special role in
projects. That they could show off their solutions and get feedback in
this trusted environment. This optimism was marred only by several
RSEs talking about short term contracts.

Not many I listened to talked about finishing projects (this only came
up in the context of when the research grant they were on ended. See
short term contracts above). How do you join another project? Can you
start a project? Does it have to be a Researcher who does?  Are you
able to complete the project before moving to the next one?

Above managers, is your Head of Dept. Do they know you? Do they know
you as more than a "resource"? Can you hide from them forever? Many
RSEs in the session said that many HoDs were unaware of RSE work
Note: not unaware of RSEs, unaware of even their work. This is
serious, something for UK RSE to address.

Lastly, even though there were RSEs there from mainland Europe and the
US, there was a very British discussion of overcoming imposter
syndrome. We often get very difficult things done, that no one else
can do. We should be proud to claim our achievements without being
arrogant about it. We should also encourage, amongst ourselves, an
openness to learning more, and to admitting that there are things we
don't know ... but can find out. 

# Work 2

The second Work session was meant to be about the more holistic
aspects of work: how you work, what you like working on, what do you
think of your career, how you got things done.

For many RSEs in the session, they liked the fact that they choose
their own projects, that they had autonomy. But many were concerned
with that the estimates they were making, or working to acheive, were
very inadequate. They also realized that expectations of both
themselves and the researchers ("enthusiastic clients" one person
called them) needed to be managed, especially as there was a lot of
missing knowledge of the software creation process at their places of
work.

Participants here liked the fact that their work was very flexible,
that they had good core hours. But they were critical that 
communication of their colleagues and managers was "piss poor": one
person said that they would work by themselves rather than with
others; that others took, not shared, and this led to a draining of
energy.  Several people said that for issues, some of which were very
serious (alcoholism was mentioned) colleagues and managers didn't do
anything. Problems were not handled; and this happened all the
time. Several participants mentioned exploitation of juniours, and
especially short term contracts. 

	  

Clarity in your roles, in your team. 
Share work out fairly. 


Need challenges: busy is happy. 

need to be seen (visibility). Facetime is important. 

Subject specific networking, cross regional. 



Separating work & home: doing work vs thinking about it. 

Might be working on cool, but not used/useful. 
Useful -> Boring -> Reached dead end. 

Go easy on yourself. 
Quick wins on todo list.

(maybe it's an older thing; but on my council allotment lists, you end
up being old by the time you get to the front of the
queue). Exercise/Diet/Sleep. Anti-fragility.

## Have a Side Project
- Could be Technical.
- Definitely non-technical. Hobby, Allotment, Pets, Music, Sport. 

## Big Side Project: family

## I run Scratch Day at my children's school
- Do you do something like this? Should you? (Does your job have the flexibility to do this? 
)
- Reminds me why I write software; Makes a difference to kids; useful; another social circle.
 
## Look after yourself
- Exercise, diet, sleep
- Dad Film Club (suits introverted men, need not involve beer)

## Step outside your comfort zone

# Summaries.

Being recognized and valued. "Came to the workshop to be happy
RSE". Remember that we should epect to be happy. UKRSE. Problem
solving. Invested.

Travel makes up part of the community. Risk of brain drain. Watch out
for imposter syndrome. Be open, claim your acheivements. Communication
important. Management good/bad. Creative freedom. Peer review. Good
relationship w/ manager(s) needed but difficut. Short term contracts
bad.

Good to work with good colleagues. Self pressure. 

Sleep is good. But BeingInZone is better. Listen to your body. You
choose to work, don't letwork colonize your life. You can easily get a
job: you don't have to deal with this shit.


# Summary
Amazing buzz at the session.

My one big regret is that I couldn't be in each team/station all the
time. 

# Next steps

Run a similar session at RSE17.
Run them on other occassions.

Change format. Will have to experiment to see what would work, and to
get the most out of so many people being in one place at one time.
