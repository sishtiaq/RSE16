# Apology

You don't begin a talk by apologizing, but I will begin this article
by saying sorry to the RSE organizers. I'm sorry that our session
overran by 20mins. I'm sorry that everyone was so intensely occupied
with talking that I couldn't interrupt to stop them and move them on
the next activity. I'm sorry that the conference had to end later than
planned. And, while the train derailment wasn't my fault, I'm sorry to
any attendees who missed their train.

There, that's off my chest. Now to being happy...

The first thing I want to do

# Intro

how it came about



# Structure of session

how i thought to organize it.

I don't want to just talk at the front of the room. 

I don't have the answers. We all want/need to hear what everyone has
to say.

I will introduce each Section. We'll workshop each one; the workshops
will report back.

I'm going to talk for 5min about myself, and about the session. I'll
introduce the Topics (Here&Now, Work, Work 2, Life, Priorities). My
notes contain the sub-topics and some answers to the issues in these
Topics but I won't be showing them that. I'll say that I want them to:
analyze (moan, dump luggage); discuss; and then come up with actions
to issues on these Topics.

There will be a station (flipboard chart, table with A0 paper) in each
corner of the room. I'll send 20% to each station. They have 10mins to
analyze, and then 10mins to come up constructive ideas. I'll ring a
buzzer at each 10min.  20min at their station in total.

Then they are random shuffled and sent to a different station. Repeat
analyze/dump. [In fact, kept in groups.]

Once everyone's done a few stations, the stations get to report back
to everyone.

We will then wonder amongst the Groups, we will all write down
concrete actions on their Posters that will make us happier.  So,
everyone will go away with a small list of things they can change to
make themselves happier.

## Me
- 5', 10'
- Start with my Bio: work, home. What makes me happy, unhappy? 
- The one thing you'll come away with: a menu of Actions to make you happier. 

## Slide

Not me talking. you/we have answers.
topics, topic/station. unload/reload. mv && !!. Report back. Menu. 

# Here & Now

## Slide

Why are you here? Who's happy, unhappy now? Why? Did you want to be an RSE?

## Who's Happy now?
- Why have you signed up?
- If you are happy, why are you happy? Do you feel Valued? Useful? Busy?
- If you're happy, maybe you can think of a way to change your situation. 
- Happy when work is going well.
- Maybe you don't want to be happy? "Refusal to win"
- Take away: you each will have a small list of actions you can take to make you happier. 

## Do you want to be a RSE? 
- Are you a failed researcher? Or you wanted to be an engineer from the start?
- What's your motivation?
- Good Things -> Optimist, or Optimist->GoodThings? Our attitude to the situation.

## Flipchart

Happy: working with others, solve problems, like what we're doing, busy, UK RSE makes us happy, recognition. 

Are RSEs happy? How have they organized into a society? Would *researchers* do the same? 
Learn how to make others happy. 
Tencity, good lazy. 
Contained work hours.
Nobody mentioned startups. UK v US. Academia v Bay area v Civil Service. 

No need for code in publication -> No recognition by Journals. 
Enjoy the dual aspects of SE and domain -> result is a product which is used again. Analogy to successful paper cited over and over again. 
Evaluation. 
No job security despite good software/ download statistics -> brain drain -> negative feedback loop. 

Autonomy. Be in control. 
"Solving the problem"
IT ------- researcher dichotomy.
"Senior PI doesn't do research". What's the analogous role of a seniour RSE?
RSE write papers, might only do releases. 
Risk in joining a project. 

Unhappy: Role of an RSE, Uncertainty, missing feedback, lack of recognition. 
Career path unblocked by EPSRC Fellowship. A re-start, new avenues. 


restart, new avenues. 

# Work

## Slide

Your researcher and you, Your manager (JB Deal). Your project. Your HoD. Travel. 

## Your Researcher and you
- Perfect is the enemy of the good. Researcher vs Engineer motivation. 
  Scientist might only want to make this code work for just this paper;
  or they might only want to solve the ideal problem.
  Programmer might want to over-complicate.   
- How do you deal with a Researcher who can code? 
  With a Researcher who can't code? Who thinks they can code?

## You & your Manager
- AG vs JB. Researcher vs Engineer Manager. 
- What happens when your manager changes? (This might not be a common scenario for RSEs.)
 - I went over my Manager to a "Uncle" Manager. ==> Importance of contacts/networks.
- How to manage your Manager: It's an active project. 
 - AManager always wanted to talk about *his* project. Tactic: write down the three things I wanted to talk about on his whiteboard. 
- What happens when your friend becomes your manager?
 - AS and JC: tried to remain friends. JC moved away.
 - Kate & Zoe: tried but couldn't be friends any more, issues of trust. 
 - the effect of the hierarchy is inevitable
- What happens when your new manager has no idea how to manage? Parkinson's Law.
- Matrix Management: pluses and pitfalls. ARM, MSRC. 
- JB's deal: JB will watch out for me; JB will try and give me work that makes me happy 3/4 of the time.

## Your project
- how do you join a Project?
- Should this RSDE be on that project? How will these decisions be made? Who will make them? Very different situation from commercial engineering product organizations. 
- How you join a project? Up to you, up to your manager?
- Who's the Lead Researcher on that project? Are they generous, or a Lone Ranger?
- Can you start a project? Does it have to be a Researcher who does? 
- Are you able to complete the project before moving to the next one? 
- Can the RSDE be coached on the topic? Will they have a chance to learn?
 - It needn't be you stuck here. But you could be the mentor, the counsel.

## Your Head of Dept and you
- RSEs value wrt Researchers
- RSEs as "resources"


## Travel
- SI: train+tube in London. Bike in Cambridge. Now Bike or Walk. Shorter, not necessarity better.
  - But no judgement here, no blame. First World Problem. 
- AS story. Swapped from car to train. "My family says that I'm far less grumpy". IT guy, so pretty grumpy at best of times.
- Walk > Bike > Train > Car.

## Flipchart

HoD unaware of RSE work. 

Good relationship with manager. 
multiple managers responsibilites
Team spirit.
Technical communcation, uptodate.
Autonomy/ lack of management. 
short term contracts. 
Sounding board. Multiple managers, responsibility. 

Overcoming imposter syndrome: encouraging openness, admitting we don't know. 
Balanced with ability to claim our achievements. 
(British)

Importance of communcation: shared understanding makes happy collaboration. 
Informal, collaborative management common. (Can cause problems.) 

Freedom to decide project path.
Trust in work.
Evaluation of RSE work by RSE; researcher as stakeholder not "boss" makes *both* sides happier. 
Travel: MSR speical case, in-company opportunities. Others: travel yes but typically not because of code.

Travel: happy, exhausted. No budget!? No travel because of code. 
Researchers presenting some results of my work in very nice environment.  who is presenting my work? researchers at "their" conferences --> :-(
show off your solutions -> feedback. 
Like projects.
Unique & critical special role. 
Be part of community (conference). 

# Work (holistic)

## Slide

Working with others. New/Useful/cool/OSS. Commercialization. 
Flexible/part-time. Projects. Performance Review. Mentor. Pay. Career. GTD. RSELunches. 

## Your work
- work with others. Work with others outside your lab. (Might not always be possible.)
 - AudienceSurvey: Ask about their team sizes.
 - work with others of wide backgrounds (not necessarily coders)
- work on something useful. Prob will be the case here.
- Work on cool things.
- Work on open source. ditto.
- Work on things that matter. 
 - Ignore or automate dull things like infrastructure. 
- Flexible work: from home, Part time work.
- Several projects on the go at once:
 - SLAyer and BMA. Had to split the week in the end. 
- How is your performance judged? Bugs fixed, SW produced, papers authored.
- Commercialization of your work


## Learn something new
- Conflict between your Project Manager and You.
- Find a place where you can learn something new. Me: schannel server in C++.
- Using current, different, cool tech. 
- Mentor. Your mentor; you a mentor to others. 
- Do different things, different types of projects (APT).

## Your pay
- Happy with your current pay? Do you know you are being paid equally (gender, race)? 
- BH: bioinformations paid more than scientists at Sanger: "They wrote the code a 
  long time ago. Now they get paid for algorithms they didn't 
  invent, running on data they didn't collect."
- vs a Bank.
- How much is enough?Can you downshift for more happiness? Move to Thailand?
- AudienceSurvey: anonymous survey, put postit note into box, your salary rounded to 10K.  
- free things (cake, t-shirts, lunch) make us happy

## Your career
- Do you have one? Do you want one? Do you stumble from project to project?
- Opportunities: manage other RSEs, Senior & Principal RSE; vs SDE in a product company.
 - Transition to Researcher

## Getting Things Done
- ToDo lists and systems: GTD, Productivity Ninja, outlook calender.
- Are you on top of things? Are you drowning? 
- Should you be organized? More organized? 
- "you will never get everything done"

## My RSDE lunches
- sell to your manager. Don't invite them.
- Let off steam.

## Flipchart

Underestimation of effort. 
Fridday morning tennis. 
Need challenges: busy is happy.
need to be seen (visibility). Facetime is important. 
Like minded colleagues are needed. 
Subject specific networking, cross regional. 
Enthusiastic clients :-)

Flexible. Core hours. 
Communication: piss poor, work by myself rather than with others, adapting yourself to others. 

Exploitation of juniors. 
Missing knowledge of software creation process (complexity). 

Pressure from perfectionism, inability to estimate. 
Go easy on yourself. 
Quick wins on todo list. 
Better estimates: identify person, estimate, how confident?

Managing expectations of ourselves and researchers. 
Separating work & home: doing work vs thinking about it.

Choose your project: autonomy. 
Funding: short term contracts. 
Colleagues/managers don't do anything. Problems not handled. all the time. 

Others taking, not sharing. 
Draining of energy. 
Clarity in your roles, in your team. 
Share work out fairly. 
Might be working on cool, but not used/useful. 
Useful -> Boring -> Reached dead end.

# Life

## Slide

Side Projects. Family. Scratch Day @ School. DadFilmClub. Allotment. Exercise/Diet/Sleep. Anti-fragility. 

## Have a Side Project
- Could be Technical.
- Definitely non-technical. Hobby, Allotment, Pets, Music, Sport. 

## Big Side Project: family
- AudienceSurvey: age, partner, children. 
- Family keeps you grounded.
- Children re-prioritize your life.
- Good or Bad? Just different. But *you* grow as a person. 

## I run Scratch Day at my children's school
- Do you do something like this? Should you? (Does your job have the flexibility to do this? 
)
- Reminds me why I write software; Makes a difference to kids; useful; another social circle.
 
## Look after yourself
- Exercise, diet, sleep
- Dad Film Club (suits introverted men, need not involve beer)

## Step outside your comfort zone
- "It's Not if you get injured, it's when you do" Coach Sommer. SLS mobility drills.
- Nicholas Taleb's Anti-Fragility. Ido Portal application to movement. 

## Flipchart

Sleep/relaxation is good. For Problem perception. 
Don't take me out of the flow/zone -> genuine joy/full control. 
Work life balance. independence.
Find your productive time. And let other poeple at theirs. 

Pilates, Family, Road cycling/touring, Long holidays, Greenpower F24 car racing, Dancing, Coder Dojo, Seminars (tangential)
salary cuts/ p/t is difficulty (family) lack of understanding/support. 

Work/life balance important: changes at diffent times, transitions in balance difficult, not always your choice, working at home, part time positives/negatives expectations/realistic. 
public engagement: science busking, soapbox science. 
school governor
open source community engagement
work + personal time.

relaxing: exercise, cooking, reading. not computer. out of comfort zone: leanring skills not commuting.
Outside work, friends. 
Music, art, ice skating. 

relaxing with/without computer (relax the brain) 
open source community engagement 
leaving comfort zone

Flexibility/Autonomy/Stability. (Triangle relationship)
keep body happy.
relax your brain. 

Boundaries. 
Side projects as an escape route from feeling stuck/depressed. allow self free choice, sense of achievement. 
Mediation/Mindfulness.
Some people needs lots of non-computer activities.
Focus on other people.
Varied networks of people: diff perspectives. 

Don't let work colonise your life. 
Being employable, job freedom. 
Singing. 
Videogames
Flying trapeze.
Board games. 


# Priorities
- https://github.com/blog/2206-reorder-issues-within-a-milestone
- yours vs Researchers 




# Summaries.

Being recognized and valued. "Came to the workshop to be happy
RSE". Remember that we should epect to be happy. UKRSE. Problem
solving. Invested.

Travel makes up part of the community. Risk of brain drain. Watch out
for imposter syndrome. Be open, claim your acheivements. Communication
important. Management good/bad. Creative freedom. Peer review. Good
relationship w/ manager(s) needed but difficut. Short term contracts
bad.

Good to work with good colleagues. Self pressure. 

Sleep is good. But BeingInZone is better. Listen to your body. You
choose to work, don't letwork colonize your life. You can easily get a
job: you don't have to deal with this shit.
